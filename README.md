# Algoz
my latest project built with React.js. It's a website that visualizes important algorithms, including linear search, binary search and BFS. I've implemented useful algorithms and experienced the power of React.js. The website is responsive on all devices.

Used some of the most important react features such as hooks and routing, In addition to implementing the Search algorithms from scratch.

More algorithms to be added soon.
